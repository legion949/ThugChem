1,Reactives presentation,"The Oxide is placed and then the water separated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
To the right of the oxygen an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.",The selected element is '_element1_' with valence _valence1_.,The selected element is '_element1_' with valence _valence1_.
2,Product presentation (Hydroxide),"To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an Hydroxide. 
The structure of the Hydroxide is the element and Hydroxyl group together (without space between them) indicating
that are part of the same molecule. In principle the subdice of element and hydroxyl in products will be 1 in both cases.",A Hydroxide is a ternary compound.,A Hydroxide is a ternary compound.
3,Details for Hydroxile composition,"The subscripts in the Hydroxide are changed. 
In Hydroxide sub-index of the hydroxyl group will be the valence of the element.
In Hydroxide the element subscript will be the valence of the hydroxyl (is 1).","In Hydroxide the subscript of '_element1_' will be 1, and the subscript of Hydroxyl will be _valence1_.","In Hydroxide the subscript of '_element1_' will be 1, and the subscript of Hydroxyl will be _valence1_."
4,Element balance,"We proceed to balance the Element.
The sub-index of the Element from Oxide in reactives will be  the coefficient of the hydroxide in products.",The new coefficient of Hydroxide is _coef3_.,The new coefficient of Hydroxide is _coef3_.
5,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the  Hydrogen. 
This form will finally balance the entire equation. 
This new coefficient for water will be calculated as the quantity of the Hydrogen into products divided the amount of the element into reactants.
 The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the water in reagents, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",The new coefficient for water is _coef2_.,The coefficient remains as is. It is still 1.
6,Conform Oxygen balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in the before step. We must confirm that.,Nothing else to do.,Nothing else to do.
7,Coefficients simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the same greatest common divisor (gcd).",The coefficients are simplified by _mcd_coef_. This is the final equation.,It is not possible to simplify the coefficients further. This is the final equation.
