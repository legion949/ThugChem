1,Reactives presentation,"The Oxide is placed and then the water separated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
To the right of the oxygen an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.",Coming soon…
2,Product presentation (Hydroxide),"To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an Hydroxide. 
The structure of the Hydroxide is the element and Hydroxyl group together (without space between them) indicating
that are part of the same molecule. In principle the subdice of element and hydroxyl in products will be 1 in both cases.",Coming soon…
3,Details for Hydroxile composition,"The subscripts in the Hydroxide are changed. 
In Hydroxide sub-index of the hydroxyl group will be the valence of the element.
In Hydroxide the element subscript will be the valence of the hydroxyl (is 1).",Coming soon…
4,Element balance,"We proceed to balance the Element.
The sub-index of the Element from Oxide in reactives will be  the coefficient of the hydroxide in products.",Coming soon…
5,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the  Hydrogen. 
This form will finally balance the entire equation. 
This new coefficient for water will be calculated as the quantity of the Hydrogen into products divided the amount of the element into reactants.
 The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the water in reagents, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",Coming soon…
6,Conform Oxygen balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in the before step. We must confirm that.,Coming soon…
7,Coefficients simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the same greatest common divisor (gcd).",Coming soon…
