1,Reactives presentation,"Hydroxide and Oxacid was placed aseparated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
To the right of the Oxacido an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.",Coming soon…
2,Product presentation (Oxosalt and Water),"In products we details Oxosal and Water separated both with a ""+"" sign.
Oxosal without subindex.
Water with normal index.
Coefficients are 1 for each one.",Coming soon…
3,Oxosalt details,"The subindex in the Oxosalt are changed.
In the Oxosal, the Ion Oxacid subindex is the subindex for the Hydroxyle from reactives. This is the metal valance.
In the Oxosal, the new Metal subindex is the Hydrogen subindex in the Oxacid.",Coming soon…
4,Oxosalt subindexes simplification,"If is possible we must simplify subindex in the Oxosal.
If that is possible, only simplify without modify coefficient for the Oxosal.",Coming soon…
5,Metal balance,The new coefficient for Hydroxide in reactives will be our metal index in Oxosalt.,Coming soon…
6,Non-metal balance,The coefficient for Oxacid in reactives will be our ion oxacid index in Oxosalt.,Coming soon…
7,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the  Hydrogen. 
To balance Hydrogen we must only modicate the coefficient in Water.
This new coefficient for the Water will be calculated as the quantity of the Hydrogen into reactives divided the amount of the Hydrogen in products.
The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the Water in products, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",Coming soon…
8,Oxygen balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in the before step. We must confirm that.,Coming soon…
9,Coefficient simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same greatest common divisor (gcd).",Coming soon…
