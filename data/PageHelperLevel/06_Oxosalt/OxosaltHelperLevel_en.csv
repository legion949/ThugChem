1,Reactives presentation,"Hydroxide and Oxacid was placed aseparated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
To the right of the Oxacido an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.","We put the valences in Roman numerals on each item to have them as a reference.
The selected elements are '_element1_' with valence _valence1_ and '_element2_' with valence _valence2_. ","We put the valences in Roman numerals on each item to have them as a reference.
The selected elements are '_element1_' with valence _valence1_ and '_element2_' with valence _valence2_. "
2,Product presentation (Oxosalt and Water),"In products we details Oxosal and Water separated both with a ""+"" sign.
Oxosal without subindex.
Water with normal index.
Coefficients are 1 for each one.",A Salt is a binary compound.,A Salt is a binary compound.
3,Oxosalt details,"The subindex in the Oxosalt are changed.
In the Oxosal, the Ion Oxacid subindex is the subindex for the Hydroxyle from reactives. This is the metal valance.
In the Oxosal, the new Metal subindex is the Hydrogen subindex in the Oxacid.",In the Salt the subscript of the element '_element2_' will be '_sub6_' and the subscript of the element '_element1_' will be '_sub5_'.,In the Salt the subscript of the element '_element2_' will be '_sub6_' and the subscript of the element '_element1_' will be '_sub5_'.
4,Oxosalt subindexes simplification,"If is possible we must simplify subindex in the Oxosal.
If that is possible, only simplify without modify coefficient for the Oxosal.",Subscripts in Salt have been simplified by _mcd_index_.,In this case it is not possible to simplify the subscripts of the Salt. They remain as they are.
5,Metal balance,The new coefficient for Hydroxide in reactives will be our metal index in Oxosalt.,The new coefficient of Hydroxide in reactants is _coef1_,The coefficient of Hydroxide in reagents is still 1.
6,Non-metal balance,The coefficient for Oxacid in reactives will be our ion oxacid index in Oxosalt.,The new coefficient of Hydracid in reactants is _coef2_,The coefficient of the Hydracid in reagents is still 1.
7,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the  Hydrogen. 
To balance Hydrogen we must only modicate the coefficient in Water.
This new coefficient for the Water will be calculated as the quantity of the Hydrogen into reactives divided the amount of the Hydrogen in products.
The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the Water in products, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",The new coefficient of Water in products is _coef4_.,The coefficient of Water in products is still 1.
8,Oxygen balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in the before step. We must confirm that.,Confirm Oxygen Balancing!,Confirm Oxygen Balancing!
9,Coefficient simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same greatest common divisor (gcd).",The coefficients are simplified by _mcd_coef_. This is the final equation.,It is not possible to simplify the coefficients. This is the final equation.
