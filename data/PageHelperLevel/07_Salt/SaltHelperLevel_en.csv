1,Reactives presentation,"Hydroxide and Hydracid was placed aseparated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
To the right of the Oxacid an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.",Coming soon…
2,Product presentation (Salt and Water),"In products we details Salt and Water separated both with a ""+"" sign.
Salt without subindex.
Water with normal index.
Coefficients are 1 for each one.",Coming soon…
3,Salt details,"The subindex in the Salt are changed.
In the Salt, the Non-metal is the Metal valance.
In the Salt, the new Metal subindex is Non-metal valence.",Coming soon…
4,Salt subindexes simplification,"If is possible we must simplify subindex in the Salt.
If that is possible, only simplify without modify coefficient for the Salt.",Coming soon…
5,Metal balance,The new coefficient for Hydroxide in reactives will be our metal index in Salt.,Coming soon…
6,Non-metal balance,The coefficient for Hydracid in reactives will be our Non-metal index in Salt.,Coming soon…
7,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the  Hydrogen. 
To balance Hydrogen we must only modicate the coefficient in Water.
This new coefficient for the Water will be calculated as the quantity of the Hydrogen into reactives divided the amount of the Hydrogen in products.
The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the Water in products, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",Coming soon…
8,Oxygen balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in the before step. We must confirm that.,Coming soon…
9,Coefficient simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same greatest common divisor (gcd).",Coming soon…
