1,Reactives presentation,"The Oxide is placed and then the water separated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
To the right of the oxygen an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.",The selected element is '_element1_' with valence _valence1_.,The selected element is '_element1_' with valence _valence1_.
2,Product presentation (Oxacid),"To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an Oxacid. 
The Oxacid structure is Hydrogen, element and Oxygen together (without space between them) indicating
that are part of the same molecule. In principle the subdice of each one is will be 1 in all cases.",An Oxacid is a ternary compound.,An Oxacid is a ternary compound.
3,Oxacid composition - Hydrogen subindex,"If valence of the element is inpar, subindex for Hydrogen is 1.
If valence of the element is par, subindex for Hydrogen is 2.","The selected valence of element '_element1_' is _valence1_, which is odd. The subscript of Hydrogen in Oxacid must be 1.","The selected valence of element '_element1_' is _valence1_, which is even. The subscript for Hydrogen in Oxacid must be 2."
4,Oxacid composition - Oxygen subindex,"The subindex for Oxygen must balance the sign loads in the Oxacid. We must remenber, de valence of Oxygen es 2.",The new subscript for Oxygen in Oxacid will be _sub7_.,"The new subscript for Oxygen in Oxacid will be _sub7_.
Therefore there are no changes. "
5,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the  Hydrogen. 
This new coefficient for the Oxacid will be calculated as the quantity of the Hydrogen into reactives divided the amount of the Hydrogen in products.
 The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the Oxacid in products, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",The new Oxacid coefficient is _coef3_.,"The new Oxacid coefficient would be _coef3_, therefore there are no changes."
6,Element balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in the before step. We must confirm that.,Confirm the balancing of _element1_!,Confirm the balancing of _element1_!
7,Oxygen balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in 5th step. We must confirm that.,Confirm Oxygen Balancing!,Confirm Oxygen Balancing!
8,Coefficient Simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same greatest common divisor (gcd).",The coefficients are simplified by _mcd_coef_. This is the final equation.,The coefficients cannot be further simplified. This is the final equation.
