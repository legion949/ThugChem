1,Reactives presentation,"The Oxide is placed and then the water separated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
To the right of the oxygen an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.",Coming soon…
2,Product presentation (Oxacid),"To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an Oxacid. 
The Oxacid structure is Hydrogen, element and Oxygen together (without space between them) indicating
that are part of the same molecule. In principle the subdice of each one is will be 1 in all cases.",Coming soon…
3,Oxacid composition - Hydrogen subindex,"If valence of the element is inpar, subindex for Hydrogen is 1.
If valence of the element is par, subindex for Hydrogen is 2.",Coming soon…
4,Oxacid composition - Oxygen subindex,"The subindex for Oxygen must balance the sign loads in the Oxacid. We must remenber, de valence of Oxygen es 2.",Coming soon…
5,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the  Hydrogen. 
This new coefficient for the Oxacid will be calculated as the quantity of the Hydrogen into reactives divided the amount of the Hydrogen in products.
 The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the Oxacid in products, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",Coming soon…
6,Element balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in the before step. We must confirm that.,Coming soon…
7,Oxygen balance,The Oxygen balance was ready in 5th step. We must confirm that.,Coming soon…
8,Coefficient Simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same greatest common divisor (gcd).",Coming soon…
