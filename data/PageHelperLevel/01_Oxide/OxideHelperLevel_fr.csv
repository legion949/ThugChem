1,Reactives presentation,"The first element is placed and then the oxygen separated both
with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
No subscripts or coefficients added, yet.
In computing, coefficients and subscripts equal to 1.
and only in reagents. Nothing in products.
To the right of the oxygen an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.","We put the valences in Roman numerals on each item to have them as a reference.
The selected element is '_element1_' with valence _valence1_.
Oxygen has valence 2. ","We put the valences in Roman numerals on each item to have them as a reference.
The selected element is '_element1_' with valence _valence1_.
Oxygen has valence 2. "
2,Reactives details,"The oxygen in reactants has a subscript 2 because it is a gas.
If the element that will react with oxygen is also a gas
and it is not a Noble gas, it will also have a two as a subscript.","Oxygen is a gas. It will always have a subscript 2. In this case, _element1_ is also a gas, therefore it must have a subscript 2 in reactants.","Oxygen is a gas. It will always have a subscript 2. In this case the _element1_ is not a gas, therefore it will not have a subscript 2 in reactants."
3,Product presentation (Oxide),"To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an oxide. The structure of the oxide is the
element and oxygen together (without space between them) indicating
 that are part of the same molecule. In principle the subindex of element and oxygen in products will be 1 in both cases.",An Oxide is a binary compound.,An Oxide is a binary compound.
4,Details about the Oxide,"The subindex in the Oxide are changed.
In Oxide ... the sub-index of the element will be the valence of oxygen.
In Oxide ... the oxygen subscript will be the valence of the element.","The valences were detailed in Roman numerals. In Oxide the subscript of '_element1_' will be 2, and the subscript of Oxygen will be _valence1_.","The valences were detailed in Roman numerals. In Oxide the subscript of '_element1_' will be 2, and the subscript of Oxygen will be _valence1_."
5,Oxide simplification,"If possible, in the oxide, the subscripts are simplified by the least common divisor (gcd). If it has been possible to simplify the subscripts, the gcd is placed as the coefficient of oxide.",Oxide subscripts were simplified by _mcd_index_. And that value is now the Rust coefficient.,In this case simplifying the subscripts is not possible.
6,Oxygen balance,"This step 6 balances only Oxygen. If the amounts of oxygen in reactants and products are not equal
 the subscript of oxygen in the oxide will be placed as a coefficient
 of oxygen in reagents, and the oxygen subscript will be placed
 in reagents as a coefficient of oxide in products. This procedure
 ment balances the amount of oxygen in the equation.",The new coefficient of Oxide will be _coef2_ and the new coefficient of Oxygen in reagents will be _coef3_.,The new coefficient of Oxide will be _coef2_ and the new coefficient of Oxygen in reagents will be _coef3_.
7,Element balance,"This step7 balances only the element.  This new element coefficient will be calculated as the quantity of the element
into products divided the amount of the element into reactants.
The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the
element in reagents, and will provide the general balance of the entire
chemical equation.",The new coefficient of the '_element1_' in reactants will be _coef1_.,The new coefficient of the '_element1_' in reactants will be _coef1_.
8,Coefficient Simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same least common divisor (gcd).",The coefficients are simplified by _mcd_coef_. This is the final equation.,It is not possible to simplify the three coefficients in the equation.
