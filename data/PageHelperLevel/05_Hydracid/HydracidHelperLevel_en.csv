1,Reactives presentation,"Element is placed and then the Hydrogen separated both with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
No subscripts or coefficients added, yet.
In computing, coefficients and subscripts equal to 1.
and only in reagents. Nothing in products.
To the right of the Hydrogen an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.",Coming soon…
2,Reactives details,"The Hydrogen in reactants has a subscript 2 because it is a gas.
If the element that will react with oxygen is also a gas
and it is not a Noble gas, it will also have a 2 as a subindex.",Coming soon…
3,Product presentation (Hydracid),"To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an Hydracid. The structure of the Hydracid is the
Hydrogen and the Element together (without space between them) indicating
 that are part of the same molecule. In principle in Hydracid, subindexes of element and Hydrogen will be 1 in both cases.",Coming soon…
4,Details about Hydracid,"The subindex in the Hydracid are changed.
In Hydracid ... the sub-index of the element will be the valence of Hydrogen (1).
In Hydride ... the Hydrogen  subscript will be the valence of the element.",Coming soon…
5,Hydrogen balance,"We proceed to balance the Hydrogen.
The sub-index of the Hydrogen in Hydracid in products will be  the coefficient of the Hydrigen in reactivs.
The sub-index of the Hydrogen in reactives will be  the coefficient of the Hydracid in products.",Coming soon…
6,Element balance,"We proceed to balance the Element. 
This form will finally balance the entire equation. 
This new coefficient for Element will be calculated as the quantity of the Element into products divided the amount of the Element into reactants.
 The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the element in reagents, and will provide the general balance of the entire chemical equation.",Coming soon…
7,Coefficient Simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same least common divisor (gcd).",Coming soon…
