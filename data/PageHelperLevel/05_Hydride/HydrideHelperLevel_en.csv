1,Reactives presentation,"The first element is placed and then the oxygen separated both
with a '+' sign, both being reactive.
No subscripts or coefficients added, yet.
In computing, coefficients and subscripts equal to 1.
and only in reagents. Nothing in products.
To the right of the oxygen an arrow called ""Reaction Arrow"" is placed.
After the reaction arrow the products will be detailed.","The first element is placed and then the oxygen separated both

2,Reactives details,"The oxygen in reactants has a subscript 2 because it is a gas.
If the element that will react with oxygen is also a gas
and it is not a Noble gas, it will also have a two as a subscript.","The oxygen in reactants has a subscript 2 because it is a gas.

3,Product presentation (Oxide),"To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an oxide. The structure of the oxide is the
element and oxygen together (without space between them) indicating
 that are part of the same molecule. In principle the subindex of element and oxygen in products will be 1 in both cases.","To the right of the arrow, the reaction product will be detailed which in this case is an oxide. The structure of the oxide is the

4,Details about the Oxide,"The subindex in the Oxide are changed.
In Oxide ... the sub-index of the element will be the valence of oxygen.
In Oxide ... the oxygen subscript will be the valence of the element.","The subindex in the Oxide are changed.
In Oxide ... the sub-index of the element will be the valence of oxygen.
In Oxide ... the oxygen subscript will be the valence of the element."
5,Oxide simplification,"If possible, in the oxide, the subscripts are simplified by the least common divisor (gcd). If it has been possible to simplify the subscripts, the gcd is placed as the coefficient of oxide.","If possible, in the oxide, the subscripts are simplified by the least common divisor (gcd). If it has been possible to simplify the subscripts, the gcd is placed as the coefficient of oxide."
6,Oxygen balance,"This step 6 balances only Oxygen. If the amounts of oxygen in reactants and products are not equal
 the subscript of oxygen in the oxide will be placed as a coefficient
 of oxygen in reagents, and the oxygen subscript will be placed
 in reagents as a coefficient of oxide in products. This procedure
 ment balances the amount of oxygen in the equation.","This step 6 balances only Oxygen. If the amounts of oxygen in reactants and products are not equal

 ment balances the amount of oxygen in the equation."
7,Element balance,"This step7 balances only the element.  This new element coefficient will be calculated as the quantity of the element
into products divided the amount of the element into reactants.
The result of this operation is the new coefficient for the
element in reagents, and will provide the general balance of the entire
chemical equation.","This step7 balances only the element.  This new element coefficient will be calculated as the quantity of the element

8,Coefficient Simplification,"If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
same least common divisor (gcd).","If possible, simplify all coefficients by the
